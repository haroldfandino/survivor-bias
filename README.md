# SURVIVOR BIAS

*In every other timeline she died that night. In yours, she's still alive. For now.*

A mystery told entirely through a messaging app, where every suspect is you.
**Her Story × Emily is Away × a locked-room interrogation.**

**Tech:** React 19 + TypeScript + ink · Web · desktop & mobile browser

## The loop

1. Talk to an alternate self → learn a **claim**, filed into the evidence drawer.
2. **Quote** that claim at a *different* self → they corroborate, deflect, or counter.
3. Countered claims go **contested**. Contradictions are the puzzle.
4. Resolving a contest needs a third self's claim, so the graph forces you to circulate.

Every self has a motive to lie: in their branch they were there, and she died. Some
of them do not want you to succeed — twenty years of who they became depends on the
shape of that loss.

## Run it

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # http://localhost:4180 — compiles the story first
```

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm run story` | Compile `story/*.ink` → `src/story.json` |
| `npm run gate` | Compile **and** run the story gate. Green before any Slack post. |
| `npm run build` | Gate → typecheck → production build |
| `uv run --script tools/smoke_audio.py` | Probe the Rupert audio endpoints |

## Layout

```
story/      *.ink — the writing. THE contributor surface: plain text, no engine.
src/        React app — chat shell, evidence drawer
  lib/ink.ts    the only place tags are parsed
  state/game.ts playout timing, save/load
design/     survivor-bias-tokens.json (style lock) + mocks
tools/      build_story · lint_story · smoke_audio
docs/       AUDIO_FINDINGS.md and friends
```

## Writing for it

One ink line = one message bubble. **Tags must be inline on the text line** — a tag
on its own line binds to the *following* output and silently shifts every
attribution by one. The gate fails the build if you do it.

```ink
oh god it's really you # from: t3 # delay: 1100
that's from the week after # from: t3 # delay: 1100 # img: evidence/ford_night_01.png
~ gain(C_CAR_KEYS, "You still had Nell's car keys the next morning.", "t3")
```

| Tag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `from: t3` | sender; omit for the player |
| `delay: 900` | ms of typing indicator before the bubble lands |
| `voice: <id>` | render as a voice note |
| `img: <path>` | photo attachment, relative to `assets/` |
| `gain(id, text, who)` | file a claim (a function, not a tag) |
| `contest(id)` | mark a claim contested |

Claim prose lives in the `gain()` call and nowhere else, so writers never touch
TypeScript.

## Status

Week 1 of a 4–6 week vertical slice. TIMELINE-3 plays end to end; T-7 and T-12 are
present but unreachable by design. Art and audio are placeholders — the frames are
built so later passes are wiring, not redesign.

Story gate: `claims 4/9 obtainable · 81 paths walked · 3/3 entries terminate`

See `story/BIBLE.md` for the design, `docs/AUDIO_FINDINGS.md` for the audio contracts.
